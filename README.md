# TextComplexityEvaluation
A simple tool written in Java for evaluating the complexity of a text, to find out if and how readability can be improved

Many public institutions offer texts in simple language in their online presences in order to reduce barriers for people with reading or comprehension difficulties, or whose native language is not German. 
To evaluate the need for accessible plain text, this application can be used to assess the information content and difficulty level of a text. 
The evaluation could be based on the following criteria: 
- Length or complexity of sentences (number of subordinate clauses, number of words).
- Length or complexity of words used
- Average value of information content per number of characters

The application could also output words from the text that are considered complex or are rarely used in the German language, as an indication of which text passages should be simplified. 

The goal is to be able to pass a text to the application, which is evaluated by means of an "accessibility score" calculated from the criteria mentioned above. In addition to the score, a list of particularly complex text passages or words is output as an indication of the simplification of the text.
